Please see to the vendor doc that we've sent initially. I've explained for the bus layout


bus layout is searched based on these parameters:


Step 1:
Source to destination: (In tbl_fair)

Step 2:
see the service Id in tbl_fair then go to tbl_service and sync the serial number

Step 3:
see to the layout field in the tbl_service and sync that with the sno field in the tbl_lower

Step 4:
see to the serial number in the tbl_lower and sync with the layout id in the tbl_newlayout

Result:
The result should be the seatno,seattype
